#### Ingredients [Serves 1]: 

Boneless chicken (~250g)  

Mushrooms (4-5 button)  

Carrots (1 full, non-baby)  

Green onion (1 of those long sticks)  

Green pepper (Half of one)  

Tomatoes (2 large)  

Salt, Pepper  

Egg (1 whole)  

Cooking oil  

Cheddar cheese  

Garlic (just a dash)  

Ginger (just a dash)  

#### Preparation [~30mins]:    

1.Crush the garlic and ginger in a pestle and mortar  

2.Put the chicken in a bowl, add 1tbsp of oil to the bowl.  

3.Add crushed garlic and ginger to bowl in step-2, put salt  

and pepper on top and make sure everything coats the chicken  

properly (you may have to use your hands). Leave it to  

marinate until you're done with step-4.  

4.Cut the vegetables so that can be fed into a vegetable mincer.  

Leave the tomatoes and onions out of this.  

5.Slice the tomatoes and microwave them for 2 minutes so they get  

mushy.  

6.Put all the vegetables including the tomatoes, excluding the  

green onions in a vegetable mincer until you get a paste.  

 If the tomatoes weren't juicy enough, you may have to add  

half a cup of water. Not too much though.  

7.Low heat on a stove, add a bit of oil and cook the chicken  

until it's white from the inside (Relax, the end result isn't  

gonna be oily at all. Just don't go crazy with the oil).  

8.After the chicken is cooked, remove it and add the vegetable  

paste to the cooking utensil on the stove, high heat now +  

cover it with something. Add the cheese.  

    8.5.Half fry an egg on the vacant stove or do this before  

        if you have a single stove.  

9.In a few minutes, everything should be cooked. Just add the  

chicken to the vegetables and mix it. Let it simmer on low  

heat for a few more minutes, sprinkle some green onion/herbs  

on top, add the egg, and it's ready :D  


Note:  
  
Alternatively, you could grill the vegetables separately and  
mince them after they are cooked.  

  

Congratulations, you have prepared an awesome dish that serves 1  

person, because it's not like you're gonna have anyone over  

anyways. D:
